If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry
You know that you got me
Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building

She studying film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart

When I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot
